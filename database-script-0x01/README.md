# Airbnb Clone - Backend Database Schema

This repository contains the complete database schema and backend foundation for a full-featured Airbnb clone application. The schema is designed to be robust, scalable, and is normalized to the Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.

## üåü Features Supported by this Schema

The database design supports all core functionalities expected from a modern property rental platform:

*   üë§ **User Management:** Secure user registration and authentication with distinct roles (`guest`, `host`, `admin`).
*   üè® **Property Listings:** Comprehensive property management, including detailed descriptions, pricing, and location data.
*   üó∫Ô∏è **Structured Location Data:** Normalized location tables (`Country`, `State`, `City`) for efficient searching and filtering.
*   ‚ú® **Amenities Management:** A flexible many-to-many system for assigning various amenities (WiFi, Pool, etc.) to properties.
*   üìÖ **Booking System:** Core logic for users to book properties for specific date ranges, with status tracking (`pending`, `confirmed`, `canceled`).
*   üí≥ **Payment Processing:** A dedicated table to track payment information for each booking.
*   ‚≠ê **Reviews and Ratings:** A system for guests to leave ratings and comments on properties they've stayed at.
*   üí¨ **User-to-User Messaging:** A direct messaging feature to facilitate communication between guests and hosts.

## üíæ Database Schema

The schema is designed for a PostgreSQL database, leveraging features like `UUID` for non-sequential primary keys and `ENUM` for data consistency.
